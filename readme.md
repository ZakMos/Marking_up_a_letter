# Markup finale
0. Create you own repository on github.
0. Clone it to your computer
0. In the repository folder, create an `index.html` file with a basic structure or copy the contents of the `boilerplate` folder we created, and fulfill the brief for the assignment in the following web page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter
0. Once you are done (don't forget to make plenty of commits) push your branch up, create a PR and add me as a collaborator on github, so that you could add me as a reviewer to your pull request.

## Bonus
0. Add your own font files (to a `fonts` folder) and create a `fonts.css` in your styles folder to define them (you can see [`working-example`](https://github.com/WebUp-dci-fbw7/working-example) for an example how to do so)
0. Define at least the Regular and Bold font weights in your `fonts.css` file.
0. Don't forget to `@import` your font definition file into `main.css`
0. Write styles in `main.css` to apply the fonts to your letter
